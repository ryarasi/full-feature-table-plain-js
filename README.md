## Full featured table

This is a full-featured table written in plain JavaScript. It fetches data from a public API and renders it with client-side pagination, global search filters with ability to edit rows in place, delete rows (changes will not-persist in the server, additional code will need to be written for that), ability to select multiple rows at once and delete them in bulk among other nice features (column-resizing etc.).

This project uses [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) to accomplish these features in a minimalist manner.
